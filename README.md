    ## Description

    The Mancala Game project implements the classic Mancala board game. The game involves two players who take turns moving stones around the board, with the objective of collecting the most stones in their respective stores. The rules include picking up stones from a chosen pit, distributing them counterclockwise, and making strategic moves to capture opponent stones.
